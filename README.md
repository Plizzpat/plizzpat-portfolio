Roblox gameplay systems and scripting portfolio.

## About Me

I specialize in creating clean and maintainable Roblox systems with proper server-side validation and organized architecture.  
My goal is to build professional-quality systems that are easy to expand and optimize.

I focus on:
- Server-authoritative systems
- Remote validation and anti-exploit logic
- Modular architecture
- Performance and scalability

## Systems Included

This portfolio contains structured examples of:

- Combat System (server validated damage handling)
- Ability System (cooldowns, stamina, server logic)
- Player Data System (DataStore with retries & autosave)
- Anti-Exploit Validation
- Modular Network Layer
- Custom Signal & Resource Management utilities

All systems are written with structure, readability, and scalability in mind.

## Philosophy

Clean code > messy features  
Structure > shortcuts  
Server authority > client trust
